    <p>Posts or comments that breach Momentum's <a href="http://www.peoplesmomentum.com/ethics" target="_blank">Code of Ethics</a>, or are not relevant to the Democracy Review's remit, will be removed.</p>
    <p>Please only click ‘Request moderation’ if you think it might be in contravention of the <a href="{% url 'review:moderation' %}">Moderation Policy</a>, on the grounds of being abusive, irrelevant, or problematic in some other way. Moderation requests are only visible to the member that requests them, and the moderator. To express disagreement with a proposal, please use the comments function. If the moderator thinks that someone has flagged a proposal for moderation when in fact they are simply making a comment, they may turn it into a comment.</p>
